            <h1>Measure a machine’s heart</h1>
            <p>
                In this project, I gave a machine a kind of human-like passion
                and showed how that passion either ramps up (lights up) or fades
                away (burns out) depending on a few factors. The visual style is
                reminiscent of the data you see on an ECG machine, and all of
                that can be explored within the developer tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the github
                <a href="https://github.com/vanghoa/bonghoanho" target="_blank"

            <h2>1/ Concept – Web Development Tools:</h2>
            <p>
                The idea to utilize the developer tool as an output display had
                been on my mind for quite some time. In fact, the inspiration
                for this concept traces back to the moment I first came across
                Everest Pipkin's work–bodies.html at
                <a href="https://ifyoulived.org/bodies" target="_blank"
                    >ifyoulived.org/bodies</a
                >. This project replicates the human body within the console
                log, as the name suggests, and it left a lasting impression on
                me.
            </p>
            <img src="pipkins.png" alt="pipkins" />
            <p>
                My project deals with similar concept of exposing the internal
                structure of digital entities with the Web Development Tools. I
                find that web browsers' built-in WebDev tools are the easiest
                for regular folks to use without having to install anything
                extra. Plus, since developers use them a lot, they're pretty
                like everyday objects and have the potential to be repurposed
                for things other than development, like art.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of using developer tools as an output display, I
                introduced an additional layer of concept by transforming the
                website interface into a remote control. This twist effectively
                switched the roles, with the front-end now operating as the
                back-end and the back-end serving as the front-end.
            </p>

            <h2>2/ Concept – Light up and burn out one’s passion:</h2>
            <p>
                The remote control featured a variety of buttons, each with a
                specific function. Each button had a distinct effect on the
                'passion' visualizer, simulating how one's enthusiasm and
                passion could either intensify (light up) or diminish (burn
                out). These effects were influenced by a range of internal and
                external factors, mirroring the complexities of real-life
                experiences where passion can fluctuate due to various
                influences.

                Visualizing camera projection into ASCII art, this was added
                when I tried to improve this project as a submission to HTML

            <h2>3/ Development:</h2>
            <p>
                This website was a valuable learning experience for me in
                creating ASCII animations using JavaScript. I divided the
                animation process into three key parts: position calculation,
                mapping to an array, and rendering it on the DOM so that it can
                be displayed into the Element window of the Dev Tool.
